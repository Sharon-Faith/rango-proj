#### Jupyter notebook
#### By **Laura Abuko, Sharon Faith, Moureen Mungai and Kevin Odhiambo**
## Description
The main objectives of the project were to build a model that can detect whether someone has heart disease and to determine the top features influencing the presence/absence of heart disease. Information from [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) was used. Exploratory analysis and modelling were carried out to aid in achieving the objective.
